## Quick Start

Get up and running with NetworkMapper in under a minute. Choose the method that best fits your needs.

### üê≥ Docker Method (Recommended for All Users)

This is the easiest and most reliable way to run NetworkMapper, as it works on any system (Windows, macOS, Linux) with zero setup.

1.  **Install Docker:** If you don't have Docker, run our setup script to install it automatically:
    ```bash
    # Make sure the script is executable first
    chmod +x ./scripts/docker.sh
    ./scripts/docker.sh
    ```

2.  **Build & Run:** Use our simple `Makefile` command to build the image and start the application:
    ```bash
    make docker-run
    ```

That's it! The interactive menu will start. For more advanced Docker usage, please see our detailed **[Docker Setup Guide](./DOCKER_README.md)**.

### üíª Local Python Method (For Developers)

This method is for users who want to run the tool directly in a local Python environment.

1.  **Run the Setup Script:** This script will check dependencies and set up your environment.
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./scripts/setup.sh
    ./scripts/setup.sh
    ```

2.  **Install the `mapper` Command:** This final step makes the tool available system-wide.
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

3.  **Run from Anywhere:** You can now run the tool from any directory.
    ```bash
    mapper
    ```

## Installation

Choose one of the following installation paths.

### üê≥ Option 1: Docker Installation (Recommended)

Using Docker is the most straightforward way to get started. It bundles all dependencies and configurations into a self-contained environment.

Our `Makefile` simplifies the entire process.

1.  **Install Docker:**
    Run our automated script to install Docker and Docker Compose if you don't have them.
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./scripts/docker.sh && ./scripts/docker.sh
    ```

2.  **Build the Image:**
    This command reads the `Dockerfile` and builds the application image. You only need to do this once.
    ```bash
    make docker-build
    ```

For detailed instructions on running with different options, managing data, and troubleshooting, please refer to the **[Docker Setup Guide](./Docker.md)**.

### üíª Option 2: Local Python Installation

Follow these steps to set up a local development environment.

#### 1. System Dependencies

First, ensure you have the required external scanning tools. Our setup script can check for and install them for you.

*   **Required:** `nmap`
*   **Recommended:** `masscan`, `arp-scan`

#### 2. Automated Setup

Our `setup.sh` script automates the entire process:
*   Checks for system dependencies and helps you install them.
*   Creates a Python virtual environment in `./venv/`.
*   Installs all required Python packages from `ops/requirements.txt`.

To run it:
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x ./scripts/setup.sh

# Run the setup process
./scripts/setup.sh
```

#### 3. Install the Command (Final Step)

After running the setup script, run the following command to create a system-wide `mapper` command for easy access:
```bash
make install
```
This will prompt for your `sudo` password to create a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin`.

## Usage

How you run NetworkMapper depends on your installation method.

### üê≥ Running with Docker

The `Makefile` provides the easiest way to interact with the Docker container.

**Start the interactive menu:**
```bash
make docker-run
```

**Run a non-interactive scan:**
Pass arguments directly to the container.
```bash
docker-compose run --rm networkmapper --target 192.168.1.0/24 --scan-type deeper
```
> For more commands, see the **[Docker Setup Guide](./DOCKER_README.md)**.

### üíª Running Locally

**If you used `make install`:**
You can run the application from any directory in your terminal.

**Start the interactive menu:**
```bash
mapper
```
**Run a non-interactive scan:**
(Note: Some scan types like `deeper` or `fast` require root privileges)
```bash
sudo mapper --target 10.0.0.0/16 --scan-type fast
```

**If you only used `make setup` (developer mode):**
You must run the tool from within the project directory using the `Makefile`.

**Start the interactive menu:**
```bash
make run
```
**Run a non-interactive scan:**
```bash
make scan TARGET=192.168.1.0/24 TYPE=fast
```

## Remote Access Setup

NetworkMapper includes a built-in web server for accessing reports remotely.

### 1. Local Network Access
After completing a scan, the web server automatically starts:
```bash
make mapper
# Note the URLs displayed after scan completion:
# Local: http://localhost:5000
# Network: http://YOUR-IP:5000
```

Access from any device on the same network using the network URL.

### 2. Remote Access (Secure Methods)

#### SSH Port Forwarding (Recommended)
From your remote machine:
```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:5000 user@scanner-host
# Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

#### VPN Access
If you have VPN access to the network:
```bash
# Connect to VPN, then access directly
http://scanner-host-ip:5000
```

### 3. Cloud Deployment

#### Quick Cloud Setup (AWS/GCP/Azure)
1. Launch Ubuntu 20.04+ VM instance
2. Configure security group to allow SSH (port 22) from your IP
3. Install NetworkMapper:
```bash
ssh ubuntu@your-vm-ip
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip nmap arp-scan git -y
git clone <your-repo>
cd networkmapper-v2
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run scan and access via SSH tunnel:
```bash
# On VM
python3 mapper.py

# From your machine
ssh -L 8080:localhost:5000 ubuntu@your-vm-ip
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

### 4. Alternative Access Methods

#### File Transfer
If remote web access isn't available:
```bash
# Copy reports to local machine
scp user@scanner-host:~/networkmapper-v2/output/reports/*.html .
scp user@scanner-host:~/networkmapper-v2/output/exports/*.pdf .
```

#### Simple HTTP Server
For one-time sharing of static reports:
```bash
cd output/reports
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Access via http://scanner-host:8000
```

### Security Notes
- Default configuration only binds to localhost for security
- Use SSH tunneling for remote access instead of exposing ports
- Reports may contain sensitive network information
- Only scan networks you own or have permission to scan

## Security Considerations

- Only scan networks you own or have permission to scan
- SNMP credentials are stored locally (use SNMPv3 for encryption)
- Vulnerability data is cached locally
- No data is sent to external services except service names for CVE lookup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied**
```bash
# Some scans require root privileges
sudo python3 mapper.py
```

**No Devices Found**
- Verify target format (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- Check network connectivity
- Try ARP scan for local networks

**Slow Scans**
- Use Discovery scan for large networks
- Enable masscan for faster discovery
- Scan during off-peak hours

**Missing Vulnerabilities**
- Ensure internet connectivity for API access
- Check if services were detected properly
- Review cached data in `output/cache/`
