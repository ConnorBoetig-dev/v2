# WebGL and Critical Device Fixes Applied

## 1. WebGL Context Error Fix ✅

**Problem**: "Multiple instances of Three.js being imported" and "Error creating WebGL context"

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `isDisposed` flag to prevent multiple animation loops
- Added proper `dispose()` method to clean up Three.js resources:
  - Cancels animation frames
  - Disposes geometries, materials, and textures
  - Forces WebGL context loss
  - Clears all references
- Modified `switchView()` to always dispose 3D visualization when switching views
- 3D visualization is now recreated fresh each time to ensure clean WebGL context

**Key Changes**:
- `network_visualization.html` lines 1678: Added `isDisposed` flag
- `network_visualization.html` lines 1987-1989: Check isDisposed in animate loop
- `network_visualization.html` lines 2151-2208: New dispose() method
- `network_visualization.html` lines 2225-2244: Updated switchView() to dispose properly

## 2. Critical Device Logic Fix ✅

**Problem**: Devices not marked as critical despite having >3 connections

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed logic from counting "dependents" to counting actual "connections"
- Added `getConnectionCount()` method to both 2D and 3D visualizations
- Updated all critical device checks to use connection count > 3

**Key Changes**:
- `network_visualization.html` lines 1592-1601: Added getConnectionCount() for 2D
- `network_visualization.html` lines 1276-1288: Updated node stroke/width based on connections
- `network_visualization.html` lines 1351-1356: Updated node radius based on connections
- `network_visualization.html` lines 1213: Updated collision radius for force simulation
- `network_visualization.html` lines 2123-2146: Added getConnectionCount() for 3D
- `network_visualization.html` lines 2116-2121: Updated 3D node radius
- `network_visualization.html` lines 1780-1783: Updated 3D glow effect
- `network_visualization.html` lines 2458-2461: Updated tooltip to show connections
- `network_visualization.html` lines 2367-2377: Updated device details panel

## 3. Report Template Threshold Update ✅

**Problem**: Report still showed ">20 dependents" threshold

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated all references from ">20" to ">3" in report.html
- Fixed high dependency device filtering

**Key Changes**:
- `report.html` line 1229: Changed threshold from 20 to 3
- `report.html` line 1250: Updated label from ">20 dependents" to ">3 dependents"
- `report.html` line 1294: Updated conditional highlighting threshold

## 4. Risk Propagation and Visualization Updates ✅

**Already updated in previous work**:
- `utils/risk_propagation.py` lines 308, 374: Changed from >20 to >3
- `utils/visualization.py` line 203: Changed critical grouping from >20 to >3

## Testing the Fixes

To verify these fixes work:

1. **Test WebGL fix**:
   - Open network visualization
   - Switch between 2D and 3D views multiple times
   - Check browser console - should see no WebGL errors
   - 3D view should display properly each time

2. **Test critical device marking**:
   - Look for devices with more than 3 connections
   - They should have red borders in 2D view
   - They should have red glow in 3D view
   - Hover tooltip should show "Critical Device (X connections)"
   - Device details panel should show critical status

3. **Test report threshold**:
   - Generate a report
   - Check "Critical Assets" tab
   - "High Dependencies" card should show ">3 dependents"
   - Devices with >3 connections should be highlighted

## How Connection Counting Works

The new logic counts actual network connections (links) rather than logical dependencies:
- Each link between two devices counts as 1 connection for both devices
- A device with connections to 4+ other devices is marked critical
- This is more accurate than the previous "dependent" counting
- Works in both 2D and 3D visualizations
