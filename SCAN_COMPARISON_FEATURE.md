# Scan Comparison Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented an advanced scan comparison feature for NetworkMapper v2 that allows users to compare network scan results over time with automatic subnet detection and visual diff display.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Interactive Comparison Interface
- Added "Compare Scans" option (option 4) to main menu
- Automatic detection and grouping of scans by subnet
- User-friendly scan selection with date/time display
- Maximum of 20 most recent scans shown for performance

### 2. Subnet Auto-Detection
- Automatically extracts primary subnet from device lists
- Groups scans by their detected /24 subnets
- Allows comparison only between scans from the same subnet
- Multi-subnet support with selection menu

### 3. Visual Diff Display
- Color-coded comparison results:
  - **Green**: New devices
  - **Red**: Missing devices  
  - **Yellow**: Modified devices
- Detailed change tracking showing:
  - Field-level changes (hostname, services, ports, etc.)
  - Added/removed services and ports
  - Summary statistics

### 4. Export Capabilities
- Multiple export formats:
  - **JSON**: Complete comparison data with metadata
  - **CSV**: Formatted summary for spreadsheets
  - **HTML**: Visual comparison report
- Auto-generated filenames with timestamps
- Option to open exported files directly

### 5. Integration with Existing Features
- Works seamlessly with existing change tracking
- HTML reports include "Compare to Last Scan" button
- Comparison data available in generate_comparison_report()

## Technical Implementation

### New Methods in mapper.py
- `compare_scans_interactive()`: Main comparison interface
- `_group_scans_by_subnet()`: Groups scan files by detected subnet
- `_detect_subnet()`: Extracts primary subnet from device list
- `_select_subnet_for_comparison()`: Subnet selection UI
- `_compare_device_lists()`: Performs detailed device comparison
- `_detect_device_changes()`: Finds field-level changes
- `_display_detailed_comparison()`: Shows color-coded results
- `_export_comparison_results()`: Exports to multiple formats

### Updated Documentation
- **USAGE_EXAMPLES.md**: Added comprehensive comparison examples
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated change tracking section
- **README.md**: Updated feature list

## Usage Example

```bash
# From main menu:
1. Select option 4: "Compare Scans"
2. Choose subnet (if multiple available)
3. Select older scan (e.g., scan #5)
4. Select newer scan (e.g., scan #1)
5. View color-coded comparison results
6. Export results (optional)
```

## Testing
- Created `test_comparison.py` for generating test data
- Verified with `test_full_system.py`
- All linting checks pass
- Code formatted with black and isort

## Benefits
1. **Network Monitoring**: Track changes in network infrastructure
2. **Security**: Detect unauthorized devices or service changes
3. **Asset Management**: Monitor device lifecycle
4. **Compliance**: Document network changes over time
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify when changes occurred

## Future Enhancements
- Scheduled comparison reports
- Comparison across different subnets
- Historical trend analysis
- Alert thresholds for changes
- Integration with monitoring systems
