# Network Mapper v2 - Latest Improvements

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Hostname Resolution in Fast Scan âœ…
**Problem**: Fast scan was not resolving hostnames
**Solution**:
- Removed `-n` flag from nmap enrichment commands to enable DNS resolution
- Added visual feedback when hostnames are successfully resolved
- Shows message: "âœ“ Hostname found for X.X.X.X: hostname.domain"
- Fast scan now explicitly states it includes hostname resolution

### 2. Enhanced Difference/Comparison Reports âœ…
**Problem**: Comparison reports were not visible/accessible enough
**Solution**:

#### A. Automatic Generation and Opening
- Comparison reports now automatically generate after every scan if changes are detected
- Reports auto-open in the browser immediately
- Clear console messages indicate the report was generated and opened
- Shows summary: "X new, Y missing, Z changed devices"

#### B. Menu Option Improvements
- Menu option 3 renamed to: "ðŸ”„ Compare to Last Scan (Auto-opens Report)"
- Makes it clear that the report will open automatically
- Option 4 remains for comparing any two specific scans

#### C. Improved Check Changes Function
- The "Check Changes" function now:
  - Generates the comparison report
  - Opens it in the browser automatically
  - Shows the file location in the console
  - Displays a success message when opened

#### D. Better Visual Feedback
- Yellow message: "ðŸ”„ Network changes detected! Generating comparison report..."
- Green success: "âœ“ Comparison Report Generated and Opened!"
- Shows report URL for manual access if needed
- Clear summary of changes in console

## How It Works Now

### Fast Scan with Full Data
```bash
python3 mapper.py
# Select option 1: Run Network Scan
# Select option 5: Fast Scan
```

The fast scan now:
1. Uses masscan for rapid discovery
2. Enriches with nmap including:
   - OS detection (with visual confirmation)
   - **Hostname resolution** (with visual confirmation)
   - Service detection
3. Shows progress for each enrichment chunk
4. Displays successful detections in real-time

### Comparison Reports
After every scan:
1. If changes are detected, you'll see:
   - "ðŸ”„ Network Changes Detected!" message
   - Table showing new/missing/modified device counts
   - Comparison report automatically generates and opens
   
2. To manually compare to last scan:
   - Select option 3 from main menu
   - Report generates and opens automatically
   - No more "file not found" errors

3. The comparison report includes:
   - Quick summary section at the top
   - Visual cards for change counts
   - Detailed device lists with changes
   - Color-coded for easy scanning

## Technical Details

### DNS Resolution
- Removed `-n` flag from enrichment commands
- Both primary and fallback enrichment now resolve hostnames
- Adds ~2-5 seconds per chunk for DNS lookups
- Worth the time for complete device information

### Report Generation
- Reports stored in: `output/reports/comparison_TIMESTAMP.html`
- Auto-opens using system default browser
- Fallback URL displayed if auto-open fails
- Reports persist for historical reference

## Usage Example

```bash
# First scan
python3 mapper.py
Select 1 (Run Network Scan)
Select 5 (Fast Scan)
Enter target: 10.0.0.0/16

# Wait for completion - note OS and hostname detections

# Second scan (same network)
python3 mapper.py
Select 1 (Run Network Scan)
Select 5 (Fast Scan)
Enter target: 10.0.0.0/16

# Automatically see:
# - Change summary in console
# - Comparison report opens in browser
# - All changes highlighted

# Or manually check changes anytime:
Select 3 (Compare to Last Scan)
# Report generates and opens automatically
```
