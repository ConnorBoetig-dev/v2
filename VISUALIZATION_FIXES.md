# NetworkMapper v2 Visualization Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. 3D Network Map Not Displaying ‚úÖ

**Problem**: The 3D view button existed but clicking it showed nothing.

**Root Cause**: The OrbitControls library was loaded from an incorrect CDN path that was incompatible with Three.js r128.

**Fix Applied**:
```html
<!-- OLD (incorrect) -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.128.0/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js"></script>

<!-- NEW (correct) -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mrdoob/three.js@r128/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js"></script>
```

**How to Verify**:
1. Run a network scan: `python3 mapper.py`
2. After scan completes, open the network visualization
3. Click the "3D View" button
4. The 3D visualization should now appear with rotating, interactive nodes

### 2. Traffic Flow Visualization Clarification ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Traffic flow report wasn't showing up, and users thought it was related to SNMP.

**Root Cause**: The traffic flow visualization is generated ONLY when passive traffic analysis is enabled during scanning - it has nothing to do with SNMP.

**How Traffic Flow Works**:
- Traffic flow visualization requires **passive traffic analysis** to be enabled
- This captures real network packets for 30-120 seconds
- It discovers "stealth" devices and traffic patterns
- Requires sudo/root privileges

**How to Generate Traffic Flow Report**:

1. Start a scan:
   ```bash
   python3 mapper.py
   ```

2. Choose scan options:
   - Select your target network
   - Choose your scan type
   - For SNMP: You can answer 'n' (not required for traffic flow)
   - **For passive traffic analysis: Answer 'y'** ‚Üê THIS IS CRITICAL
   - For vulnerability scanning: Your choice

3. The scan will:
   - Perform active scanning
   - Capture network traffic for 30+ seconds
   - Analyze traffic patterns
   - Generate THREE reports:
     - Detailed Report
     - Network Map (2D/3D visualization)
     - **Traffic Flow Report** (if passive analysis was enabled)

## Testing the Fixes

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
python3 test_visualizations.py
```

## Understanding the Reports

### 1. Network Map (2D/3D Visualization)
- **Purpose**: Visual representation of network topology
- **Features**:
  - 2D force-directed graph
  - 3D spatial view with layered devices
  - Device filtering and search
  - Change indicators for new/modified devices
- **Generated**: Always (after any scan)

### 2. Traffic Flow Report
- **Purpose**: Shows actual network communication patterns
- **Features**:
  - Live traffic flows between devices
  - Stealth device detection
  - Top traffic generators
  - Service distribution
  - Risk propagation analysis
- **Generated**: Only when passive traffic analysis is enabled
- **Requirement**: Needs packet capture (requires sudo)

### 3. Detailed Report
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive device inventory
- **Features**:
  - Device tables with all details
  - Vulnerability information
  - Service listings
  - Export options
- **Generated**: Always (after any scan)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "No traffic captured" Error
**Causes**:
1. Passive analysis not enabled during scan
2. No sudo/root privileges
3. Wrong network interface
4. No traffic during capture period

**Solution**: Re-run scan with passive analysis enabled and ensure sudo works

### 3D View Still Not Working
**Check**:
1. Browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
2. Network tab to ensure OrbitControls loaded (200 status)
3. Try a different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)

### Traffic Flow Shows but Empty
**This means**:
- Packet capture worked but no traffic was detected
- Try during busier network periods
- Ensure capture interface is correct

## Advanced Features

### Risk Propagation Analysis (Traffic Flow)
1. Open traffic flow report
2. Click "üî• Risk Analysis Mode"
3. Click any device to simulate failure
4. See cascading impact visualization

### 3D Navigation Controls
- **Left click + drag**: Rotate view
- **Right click + drag**: Pan view  
- **Scroll wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Auto Layout button**: Toggle auto-rotation

### Filtering in Network Map
- Use sidebar filters to show/hide device types
- Search by IP, hostname, or MAC
- Filter by device criticality or changes

## Performance Tips

### For Large Networks (1000+ devices)
1. Use Fast Scan mode for initial discovery
2. Limit passive analysis to 30 seconds
3. Use device type filters to reduce visual clutter
4. Consider chunked scanning for very large networks

### For Better Traffic Analysis
1. Run during peak network usage
2. Extend capture time to 60-120 seconds
3. Ensure all VLANs are accessible
4. Use mirror/SPAN ports if available

## Summary

The visualization system now works as designed:
- **3D visualization**: Fixed CDN path issue - fully functional
- **Traffic flow**: Requires passive analysis during scan - not SNMP
- **All visualizations**: Auto-open after scan completes

Remember: Traffic flow ‚â† SNMP. Traffic flow = Passive packet analysis!
