### Documentation Standards Applied

#### 1. Docstring Format
```python
def method_name(self, param1: str, param2: int = 0) -> Dict:
    """
    Brief description of what the method does.
    
    Detailed explanation including:
    - Algorithm or approach used
    - Why this approach was chosen
    - Any important side effects
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of first parameter
        param2: Description with default value noted
    
    Returns:
        Description of return value and structure
    
    Raises:
        ExceptionType: When this exception occurs
    
    Example:
        >>> result = obj.method_name("test", 42)
        >>> print(result["key"])
    """
```

#### 2. Inline Comments
- Focus on "why" rather than "what"
- Explain complex algorithms
- Note performance considerations
- Highlight security implications
- Reference external resources

#### 3. Module Headers
Each file now starts with:
- Module purpose and capabilities
- Design philosophy
- Key features
- Integration points
- Usage examples

### Key Improvements Made

#### 1. Clarity
- Complex algorithms now have step-by-step explanations
- Design decisions are documented with rationale
- Trade-offs are explicitly noted
- Edge cases are highlighted

#### 2. Maintainability
- Clear contracts between modules
- Extension points documented
- Common patterns identified
- Troubleshooting guides added

#### 3. Onboarding
- New developers can understand module purposes quickly
- AI assistants have comprehensive context
- Examples demonstrate proper usage
- Architecture documents provide system overview

#### 4. Consistency
- Uniform documentation style across all modules
- Standardized terminology
- Consistent parameter naming
- Aligned with Python best practices

### Benefits for AI-Assisted Development

The enhanced documentation specifically helps AI assistants by:

1. **Providing Context**: Each file explains its role in the larger system
2. **Explaining Intent**: Design decisions and rationales are documented
3. **Showing Patterns**: Common patterns are highlighted for consistency
4. **Defining Boundaries**: Module responsibilities are clearly defined
5. **Giving Examples**: Usage examples demonstrate proper integration

### Documentation Coverage

- **Core Modules**: 100% documented
- **Utility Modules**: 100% documented
- **Templates**: Full documentation with examples
- **Configuration**: Comprehensive inline docs
- **Architecture**: 5 detailed .claude.md files

### Next Steps for Maintainers

1. **Keep Documentation Updated**
