# Network Mapper v2 - Recent Improvements Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. OS Detection in Fast Scan ✅
**Problem**: OS detection was timing out in fast scan mode for large networks
**Solution**:
- Increased enrichment timeout from 60s to 120s per chunk
- Reduced chunk size from 50 to 25 IPs for better handling
- Added fallback mechanism: if OS detection times out, retries without OS detection
- Reduced ports scanned during enrichment (from 50 to 20) for speed
- Added visual feedback when OS is successfully detected

### 2. Enhanced Difference/Comparison Reports ✅
**Problem**: Comparison reports weren't prominent enough and didn't auto-open
**Solution**:
- Comparison reports now auto-open in browser after generation
- Added immediate change summary display after scan completion
- Enhanced comparison report template with quick summary section
- Clear visual indicators for new/missing/changed devices
- Console output shows change counts prominently

### 3. Traffic Flow Visualization ✅
**Problem**: Nodes were jittering when hovering over them
**Solution**: Fixed by removing CSS transform and using stroke-based hover effects

## Key Improvements

### Fast Scan Mode
```bash
# Now properly handles OS detection for large networks
python3 mapper.py
# Select option 5: Fast Scan
```

Features:
- Optimized for 65k+ hosts across multiple /16 subnets
- Uses masscan for discovery, then enriches with nmap
- Better timeout handling and fallback mechanisms
- Visual progress indicators for OS detection

### Comparison Reports
- Automatically generated when changes are detected
- Opens in browser alongside other reports
- Shows clear summary of:
  - New devices appeared on network
  - Devices that went offline
  - Configuration changes detected
- Improved visual design with dark theme

### Code Quality
- All code properly formatted with Black
- Linting checks pass
- Unit tests updated and passing

## Usage Tips

1. **For Large Network Scans**:
   - Use Fast Scan mode (option 5)
   - OS detection will work but may take time
   - Watch for green checkmarks showing successful OS detection

2. **For Change Tracking**:
   - Run regular scans of the same network
   - Comparison reports auto-generate and open
   - Look for the yellow "Network Changes Detected!" message

3. **For Better Performance**:
   - Fast scan processes IPs in chunks of 25
   - If timeouts occur, it automatically retries without OS detection
   - All critical data (services, ports) is preserved even on timeout

## Technical Details

- Enrichment timeout: 120 seconds per chunk
- Fallback timeout: 30 seconds (without OS)
- Chunk size: 25 IPs (optimized for large networks)
- Port reduction: Top 20 ports for enrichment (was 50)
- Visual feedback: Real-time OS detection confirmations
