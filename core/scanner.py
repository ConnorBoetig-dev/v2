"""
Network Scanner Module - Synchronous wrapper for async network scanning operations

This module serves as the primary interface for network discovery operations in NetworkMapper.
It provides a backward-compatible synchronous API while leveraging asynchronous operations
internally for massive performance improvements (5-10x for large networks).

Key Design Decisions:
- Wraps AsyncNetworkScanner to maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Automatically handles event loop creation/management for sync contexts
- Preserves the simple scan() interface while enabling parallel subnet scanning
- Supports both CLI usage (sync) and potential future async integrations

Architecture Notes:
- This is a thin wrapper - all actual scanning logic lives in scanner_async.py
- Event loop detection ensures it works in both sync and async contexts
- Cleanup operations are guaranteed through try/finally blocks

        Execute network scan with parallel execution for improved performance.

        This method maintains the synchronous interface for backward compatibility
        while leveraging async operations internally for parallel execution.

        The method intelligently detects the execution context:
        - In async context: Returns a future that can be awaited
        - In sync context: Creates an event loop and blocks until completion

        Args:

            scan_type: Scanning profile to use
                - "fast": Quick scan with minimal service detection (2-5 min)
                - "deeper": Comprehensive scan with OS/service fingerprinting (5-15 min)
            use_masscan: Enable masscan for initial host discovery
                - True: Use masscan (100k pps) then enrich with nmap
                - False: Use nmap only (slower but more compatible)
            needs_root: Whether scan requires root/sudo privileges
                - True: For SYN scans, OS detection, masscan
                - False: For basic TCP connect scans
